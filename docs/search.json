    "text": "Abstract\n\nSocietal threat perceptions – feelings that something bad is about to happen – are on the rise globally. Prior research links threat perceptions to political ideology and increased support for political leaders. However, most of this work is based on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) contexts, often studying symbolic or distant threats. We address this gap by examining political responses to real, acute threats in the context of war. Using survey data from 421 residents of the Kharkiv region in Ukraine – collected in September–December 2024 in close proximity to the front line – we test whether threat perceptions are related to political ideology and support for democracy. We find no evidence that threat is associated with ideological extremism or right-wing orientation. However, we do find that those who feel most threatened by the Russian invasion partly express stronger support for democracy. These findings highlight the importance of geopolitical context in shaping how people respond to societal threats."

    "section": "▪️ Coverage of the EU Across News Cycles",
    "text": "▪️ Coverage of the EU Across News Cycles\n\nAssigning News Content to News Cycles\nAs I was interested in examining the relationship between EU news exposure and turnout intentions over time (and eventual actual turnout), I had to identify which news coverage exposure to examine in relationship with each of the three measurement times of turnout intention and with the single measure of actual turnout.\nI wanted to examine how specific content at a specific point in time uniquely related to each wave measurement of turnout intentions. This would allow me to speculate that potentially different relationships between exposure to EU news and turnout intentions over time would perhaps be due to the exposure to news content unique to a certain news cycle. Therefore, the turnout intentions in one wave were later correlated with the consumption of unique, idiosyncratic news coverage of the EU leading up to these turnout intentions. I categorized the analyzed content into different news cycles, thereby capturing only the news individuals were exposed to in the news cycle that preceded a specific survey wave, excluding the news preceding a prior wave. Consequently, I had to create four news cycles, each containing news coverage that uniquely precedes each wave measuring turnout intentions.\nI decided that a news cycle should end on the last day of data collection of a wave with whose scores an individuals content exposure would be created. While individuals early on in the data collection wave were not exposed to this content, using this end day of a news cycle allowed me to be certain that individuals later on in a data collection wave were not exposed to content that I did not account for. Additionally, since actual turnout occurs on the day of the election and not at the point in time when the fourth measurement wave occurred, the fourth news cycle ends the day before election day (May 21st, 2014).\nFurthermore, each news cycle starts one day after the last day of data collection of a prior wave, except for the first news cycle. The first day where news content was analyzed is used as the start of the first news cycle.\nThe start and end dates of each news cycle are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n\n\nFirst News Cycle\n02.12.2013\n26.12.2013\n\n\nSecond News Cycle\n27.12.2013\n30.03.2014\n\n\nThird News Cycle\n31.03.2014\n28.04.2014\n\n\nFourth News Cycle\n29.04.2014\n21.05.2014\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a visualization of the duration of each news cycle:\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving figured out the duration of each news cycle, the content must be assigned an news cycle. I did so by creating a news cycle variable called cycle.\nAs can be seen, most news content was collected and analyzed during news cycle 2. This is unsurprising given that news cycle 2 was by far the longest.\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, across the news cycles, the number of news items collected from one type of outlet relative to the number of news items analyzed from another outlet remained consistent. Within each news cycle, most items were collected from newspapers, followed by television items, followed by items online:\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also wanted to assess in which time period most articles were gathered without categorizing items by news cycle. Most articles were gathered just before the 2014 EU elections:\n\n\nFigure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo examine whether a news item covered the EU, I altered the variable eu_evaluation by turning it into an EU coverage variable. The eu_evaluation variable is a variable that also contains information on whether a news item mentioned the EU:\n\n\n\n\n\neu_evaluation\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\n\nMentioned but not evaluated\n\n\nNegative\n\n\nRather negative\n\n\nBalanced/mixed\n\n\nNot applicable / not mentioned\n\n\nRather positive\n\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen above, the variable contains eight different values - seven of which implying that a news item mentioned the EU based on the fact that information is provided as to how the EU was evaluated. It is assumed that missing values in turn indicate that an article did not mention the EU.\nThus, a variable can be created that assigns a value of 1 to those articles mentioning the EU and a 0 to those articles not mentioning the EU (i.e. the ones with missing values on eu_evaluation). This variable was termed eu_mention.\nNow we can assess how often the EU was mentioned relative to other news content in a news cycle. As the following graph shows, the EU was mentioned the most in news cycle 4, the cycle preceding the EU elections:\n\n\nFigure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI further visualized how often the EU was mentioned in news articles across the entire time in which news items were gathered. I did this by examining the number of news items mentioning the EU relative to other news coverage on a given day. As can be seen, the coverage of the EU first decreased between early December and January, then increased until late February, decreased again until late April, and started increasing again leading up to the EU elections on May 22nd. Note that the news cycles are visualized with different colors in the background.\n\n\nFigure 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown below, the change in relative mentioning of the EU over time was very similar across the analyzed outlet types (newspapers, television channels, and online news-sites). For most of the time during which news items were collected, the online online news-site mentioned the EU more than the other two outlet types (albeit in relative terms).\n\n\nFigure 7."

    "text": "▪️ Creating Exposure Variables\nIn order to eventually correlate exposure to news coverage of the EU with election turnout intentions and actual turnout, I had to create a variable that captures the exposure of an individual to EU coverage within a certain time.\nThis was done following a method proposed by De Vreese et al. (2017).\nFirst, I multiplied the relative number of news items mentioning the EU (within a given news outlet) in the news cycle leading up to a measurement wave of political intention and the eventual election turnout with an individuals reported frequency of consuming that particular news outlet (as reported in the measurement wave following the news cycle). This reflected an exposure score to news coverage of the EU, weighted by how much the individual consumed the news outlet in the news cycle leading up to each survey wave.\nI then calculated the total sum of these weighted exposure scores per wave, resulting in a single value of exposure to EU news for an individual per wave. Values were stored in the variable eu_exposure."

No outliers seem to be present in turnout_int_eu.\n\nFigure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing outlier detection, I handled outliers on the variable of eu_exposure by replacing values greater than 1.5*IQR above the third quartile as well as values smaller than 1.5*IQR below the first quartile with the mean of eu_exposure (Note the caveats of winsorization using the mean).\nHere is the distribution of values of eu_exposure per wave after the handling of outliers:\n\n\nFigure 9."
