## Main Text

On September 4th, 2025, the US secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy (R.F.K.) Jr., appeared before the Senate Finance Committee, openly making a range of false assertions, including the denial of the effectiveness of public safety measures such as masks or vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic (Barajas et al., 2025). The perpetuation of these falsehoods raises the question of how an educated person such as Kennedy can genuinely maintain his misinformed view on the US government’s COVID-19 response in the face of overwhelming contradictory scientific evidence. Academic literature on motivated reasoning provides a potential answer.

Accordingly, whenever Secretary Kennedy encounters information that contradicts his view on COVID-19 response effectiveness, this information may be (somewhat automatically) dismissed so as not to challenge his preconceived skepticism. A study by Kahan (2013) lends credence to the possibility of R.F.K. Jr.’s motivated dismissal of scientific information. He showed that participants questioned the quality of information (in this case: fictitious scientific evidence) about their partisan ingroup when it conflicted with beliefs they held toward their ideological ingroup. However, should the educated Kennedy not be intellectually better equipped to unbiasedly acknowledge information challenging his preconceived skepticism? Not necessarily. Kahan’s experiment showed that the discounting of contradictory evidence was strongest among those engaging in *more* effortful thinking. Similarly, those with a (politically) educated background appear to discount contrary information more and judge confirming information as more convincing than uneducated individuals (Taber & Lodge, 2006). The authors argue that cognitive resources actually help to *fend off* contrary evidence. Of course, instead of genuinely not revising his skepticism, R.F.K. Jr. may be faking his persistent belief in false information so as not to upset his science-skeptical ‘Make America Healthy Again’ base. While this possibility cannot be ruled out entirely, genuine maintenance of false beliefs has been demonstrated across various political ideological groups. Research has shown that false beliefs persist despite ample contrary evidence, even when people are incentivized to be truthful (Peterson & Iyengar, 2021). Thus, it is conceivable that R.F.K. Jr. is not intentionally spreading disinformation – he may genuinely believe it.

Two questions follow. First: How much counter-attitudinal information is necessary to overwhelm motivated reasoning? For example, would the inevitable immense cost of human life due to the lack of government response in a potential future pandemic be enough counter-attitudinal information for R.F.K. Jr. to adjust his opinion? Second: What accounts for the persistence and consolidation of false beliefs? Taking a network approach, the global connectivity of a network of supportive cognitions for a false belief could perhaps increase through counterarguing, thereby strengthening the belief.
