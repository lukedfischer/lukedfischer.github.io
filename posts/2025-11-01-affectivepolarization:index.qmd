## **Introduction**

> A house divided against itself cannot stand.

—Abraham Lincoln, *House Divided Speech*, 1858

Concerns about political divides are omnipresent in discussions about contemporary politics. News headlines repeatedly lament political chasms in various democracies (e.g., Balmer, 2018; Ruf, 2024; Searcey, 2024). At the same time, political violence has proliferated (e.g., Fürstenau, 2024), supporting the notion of rifts and considerable animosity in the political sphere. Unsurprisingly, research has aimed to examine the division, or what is commonly referred to as polarization, in politics. Lelkes (2016) describes how scholars commonly refer to *existing* or *growing* political division when discussing polarization in the realm of politics. In other words, polarization refers to both a condition and a process. The author notes how political division can, inter alia, be assessed among political partisans (i.e., those who express party identifications) and on three dimensions. Ideological polarization and perceived polarization refer to actual or construed divides in partisans’ ideology, namely, “their \[…\] values or political beliefs (van Prooijen, 2021, p. 2). The third dimension of partisan division is affective polarization*,* which aims to capture political division based on interparty animosity. This latter dimension is often viewed as a threat to democratic stability (Edsall, 2024).  

To assess whether research supports this view, this paper provides an overview of affective polarization, traces its theoretical foundation, and describes its empirical antecedents. This paper then describes the extent of affective polarization internationally and its potential consequences for political systems based on behavioral outcomes. Subsequently, the conceptual clarity of affective polarization and its theoretical generalizability to multi-party contexts are critiqued. Finally, I advocate for a reconceptualization of affective polarization by considering it an attitudinal construct with multiple conceptual dimensions and contextual dependencies. Notably, non-political consequences are not discussed because this line of research has predominantly not assessed affective polarization but rather conceptual proxies (Druckman & Levy, 2022) and because the link to democratic stability is not explicit.

## **Delineating Affective Polarization**

Affective polarization had received little empirical attention until a seminal paper by Iyengar et al. (2012) shifted the conversation from ideological divisions to divisions based on social identity. A person’s social identity comprises “that part of an individual’s self-concept which derives from \[their\] knowledge of \[their\] membership of a social group (or groups) \[…\]” (Tajfel, 1978, p. 66). The authors argue that differences in political opinions insufficiently capture political divisions. Instead, a more meaningful conceptualization is the extent to which we negatively evaluate people from the out-party (i.e., the party we oppose) in contrast to how positively we evaluate people from the in-party (i.e., the party we support). Notably, positive and negative evaluations of the in- and out-party are referred to as ‘affect.’ This view on polarization draws on social identity theory (SIT; Tajfel & Turner, 1979, 1986).

SIT proposes that we aim for positive self-evaluations, and since the construal of ourselves partly depends on what groups we belong to (i.e., in-groups), we strive to evaluate our in-groups favorably. As people judge the favorability of their in-group in contrast to other groups (i.e., out-groups), people seek to view their in-groups as more favorable than their out-groups. Iyengar et al. (2012) assert that components of individuals’ social identities are based on the political in-group. Accordingly, favorable judgments of the in-party accompany unfavorable out-party judgments. Consequently, this disparity in favorability evaluations is conceptualized as a form of polarization based on affect, videlicet, “affective polarization” (Iyengar et al., 2012, p. 407). Building upon this social identity approach to polarization, Iyengar and Westwood (2015) defined affective polarization as “the tendency of people identifying as Republicans or Democrats to view opposing partisans negatively and co-partisans positively” (p. 691). While this definition is tailored to an American context, scholars outside the United States (US) have replaced the words ‘Republicans or Democrats’ with ‘partisans’ (e.g., Lee et al., 2023, p. 2).  

Iyengar et al. (2019) describe several antecedents of affective polarization with robust empirical support. One such antecedent is what Lelkes (2016) refers to as ideological consistency. As the ideological variance among co-partisans decreases, intraparty differences (and thus disagreements) subside, while interparty differences become apparent. Subsequently, this amplified perception of contrasting social identities stimulates negative out-party evaluations. Next, the authors mentioned ideological divergence (see Lelkes, 2016) as another precursor of affective polarization. Accordingly, affective polarization not only increases when parties become more ideologically homogenous but also when they become more extreme. Finally, affective polarization follows exposure to political campaigns for two reasons. Individuals’ in-party social identities become accessible, facilitating favorable comparisons relative to the out-party (see SIT). Secondly, negative campaigning that emphasizes the dangers posed by the out-party may spur negative out-party evaluations.

Iyengar et al. (2019) also present a group of potential antecedents of affective polarization with an ambiguous empirical foundation, requiring further empirical inquiry. These factors somehow limit one’s exposure to bipartisan information. If individuals predominantly consume media that aligns with their party views, if they are online more to consume such media, or if their social networks are ideologically similar, they are frequently (and perhaps exclusively) exposed to information matching their ideology and/or information that vilifies the out-party. Ideologically consistent information may be another means by which social identities come to the fore, triggering favorable in- and unfavorable out-party judgments. Additionally, if individuals repeatedly face negative out-party presentations, negative views may become internalized, echoing Gerbner’s (1969) cultivation theory.

## **Empirical Findings**

When examining country levels of affective polarization, one can assess to what extent a country is affectively *polarized* or *polarizing*. Concerning affective polarization as a process, evidence that affective polarization has been increasing in the US appears unequivocal. This is no surprise given that the term was coined based on the observation of increasingly diverging favorability evaluations of the in and out-party in the US since 1980 (Iyengar et al., 2012). Interestingly, underlying increasing affective polarization is the decreasing liking of the out-party, absent increasing liking of the in-party. Internationally, evidence is more ambiguous. In a comparison of twelve OECD countries, Boxell et al. (2024) found that beyond the US, only Denmark showcased a significant increase in affective polarization between 1973 and 2020. Contrarily, Germany and Sweden note significantly declining levels of affective polarization. These findings highlight that increasing affective polarization is not a ubiquitously occurring phenomenon.

Regarding how affectively polarized democratic systems are, Wagner (2021) compares levels of affective polarization across 51 democracies. He found that poorer countries exhibit the highest degrees of affective polarization and, exceptionally, that the level of affective polarization was highest in the US when disregarding those without party identification. Therefore, affective polarization is comparatively high among US partisans and in poorer democracies.

Turning to political outcomes, Iyengar and Krupenkin (2018) conclude that affective polarization predicts voter turnout, measured using implicit measures (i.e., self-reports). However, Ahn and Mutz (2023) paint a more nuanced picture, finding that affective polarization predicted voting intentions and self-reports of having voted, albeit not actual voting. Since the latter study included explicit measures of turnout, this finding suggests that affective polarization does not facilitate voting behavior and that implicit behavioral voting measures lack external validity. Nevertheless, Phillips (2024) noted that implicit measures may generalize under certain circumstances by finding that repeated voting moderates the association between affective polarization and actual voting. Accordingly, individuals with a history of voting turned out more when affective polarization was high. Thus, affective polarization may facilitate voting for individuals who vote repeatedly. Cross-nationally, research has not extensively examined the link between affective polarization and voting. Harteveld and Wagner (2023) conclude a positive link across Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. Yet, as demonstrated, their reliance on implicit voting measures may not generalize to actual voting. Therefore, the mobilizing role of affective polarization regarding voting in cross-national settings requires further examination.

Other political behaviors can be separated into (non-voting) norm-abiding actions like signing petitions or attending political rallies and norm-breaking behaviors like political violence (Sabucedo & Arce, 1991). Research into affective polarization and normative non-voting behavior is mixed. Lee et al. (2023) found a positive association between affective polarization and such non-voting behaviors in Korea, while Ali and Altawil (2023) did not replicate this finding in the US. Notably, both studies constructed a political participation scale in which enacting more political behaviors indicated greater political participation. However, affective polarization may only be linked to specific political behaviors. Indeed, Bettarelli et al. (2022) found that affective polarization predicts protest behavior in Belgium. Regarding political violence, research has consistently not been able to conclude a significant relationship with affective polarization across nations. Importantly, given potential external validity issues with measures of behavioral correlates of affective polarization, more direct research into specific non-voting participation and political violence is needed. However, ethical and practical obstacles apply to the latter.

To conclude, research has not found a link between affective polarization and explicit threats to political systems like political violence. On the contrary, affective polarization may, in some cases, even spur political participation, which arguably reinforces democratic stability. Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain in this line of research.

## **Empirical Problems**

Conceptual underspecifications of affect and to whom affect is directed challenge research on affective polarization, as noted by Bakker and Lelkes (2024). Based on the definition of affective polarization, affect comprises partisans’ feelings of like and dislike for their in- and out-party (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). In short, affect is only specified unidimensionally, limiting it to valence (i.e., ranging from positive to negative evaluations). Yet, there is much room for interpretation regarding what constitutes liking and disliking. Some interpret liking and disliking as the equivalent of holding positive or negative beliefs about someone, as seen in operationalizations of affective polarization where partisans judge each other’s character traits (Druckman & Levendusky, 2019). To others, liking and disliking may mean experiencing positive or negative emotions. Notably, such emotional operationalizations of affective polarization have received little attention yet may prove worthwhile because the theoretical foundation of affective polarization (i.e., SIT) draws on intergroup emotions theory (Bakker & Lelkes, 2024).

Why are such different conceptual interpretations problematic? While partisans may dislike out-party members based on both negative beliefs and negative emotions toward them, beliefs and emotions toward out-party members may not converge (e.g., Siev & Petty, 2024). For instance, partisans may dislike out-party members because they are angry at them, yet they may still consider them intelligent. In this scenario, studies operationalizing affective polarization based on emotions would conclude higher levels of affective polarization than operationalizations based on beliefs.

Similarly, affective polarization may be primarily based on emotions, beliefs, or both in certain contexts. However, the most conventionally employed operationalization of affective polarization, the feeling thermometer (Druckman & Levendusky, 2019), makes examining the conceptual underpinnings of affective polarization impossible as it superficially asks partisans to express the extent of their (dis)like toward (co)partisans. To illustrate a potential implication, some studies relying on feeling thermometers have found inconsistent evidence about the link between affective polarization and political participation (e.g., Ali & Altawil, 2023), while certain emotions seem to unambiguously predict political participation (e.g., Valentino et al., 2011). Thus, a broad conceptualization of affective polarization may gloss over different kinds of affective polarization with different conceptual foundations and, perhaps, different political consequences.

Druckman and Levendusky (2019) also highlight that the subject of (dis)liking is unclear across the literature. Consequently, different studies assess sentiment toward voters of parties, party members, or politicians in office. It appears evident that, depending on the target of affective polarization, its extent and consequences may differ substantially. In sum, the underspecification of affect and its target drives inconsistent operationalizations of affective polarization with potentially different conclusions about its presence across political groups and its political consequences.

Another issue arises from the American context in which affective polarization was conceptualized. The US is a country whose politics are dominated by two parties with whom most voters identify long-term (Atske, 2020). This stable party identification gives credence to the argument that party affiliation shapes partisan social identities in the US (Iyengar et al., 2012). Based on SIT, measuring affective polarization in the US is highly relevant, given that individuals act and feel on behalf of their groups (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). That is because, in the face of exacerbating affective polarization in the US, potentially detrimental consequences like political violence seem, at least, theoretically plausible. However, the social identity argument of party affiliation may not hold in other countries, especially those with multi-party systems. In Germany, for example, identification with one party is decreasing, with voters increasingly changing their party support from one election to the next (Korte, 2021). Thus, many German citizens’ social identities likely remain independent of the party they support. Even if affective polarization operationalizations are developed for multi-party contexts (Wagner, 2021), it is unlikely that affective polarization scores in systems with low party identification are conceptually similar to scores from the US, at least from an SIT standpoint. Therefore, in other national contexts, whether degrees of affective polarization have similar consequences as in the US is unclear.  

## **Suggestions for Future Research**

To address the potential lack of partisan social identities in non-US multi-party contexts, future research should examine the extent of party identification when investigating affective polarization in such contexts. If a given country yields similar levels of party identification, findings are likely generalizable and comparable to US ones. In this case, future research can use these contexts to replicate and extend findings on identity-based affective polarization. In the case of low party identification, affective polarization may neither generalize nor compare to US findings due to the lack of a partisan social identity, which may lead to affective polarization having different antecedents and consequences. That is not to say that research on affective polarization in these contexts is futile. Indeed, there may still be stark divergences in evaluating the in-party and multiple out-parties, albeit not due to social identities. Research must, therefore, examine the predictors of this variance in party evaluations and whether its consequences are similar or different from identity-based affective polarization. Consequently, future research can provide a more contextually nuanced understanding of affective polarization.

One remedy to the conceptual underspecification of affective polarization is to adopt a more granular conceptualization of affect. Instead of broadly defining it unidimensionally, only ranging from positive to negative evaluations, researchers may further specify what makes up such evaluative ratings of political groups. One way to do this is to conceptualize affect attitudinally. Indeed, the definition of affective polarization, referring to favorable and unfavorable evaluations of (co)partisans (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015), perfectly aligns with definitions of attitudes. The Causal Attitude Network (CAN) Model by Dalege et al. (2016) defines them “as networks of interacting evaluative reactions \[comprising\] feelings, beliefs and behaviors toward an attitude object” (p. 6). Accordingly, evaluations of attitude objects are broken up further into emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components.

Applied to affective polarization, when diagnosing how individuals evaluate in-party members comparatively to out-party members, one could measure how they feel, think, and behave toward co-partisans (intraparty attitudes) and opposing partisans (interparty attitudes). In so doing, one may find that, in particular political contexts, specific components of intra-/interparty attitudes are the primary drivers of broader measures of affective polarization, like the feeling thermometer. Determining the structure of intra-/interparty attitudes may provide insight into their potential consequences. For example, if feeling thermometers attest to a high degree of affective polarization and network analyses of interparty attitudes show that anger toward opposing partisans is the most central attitudinal component, such affective polarization may facilitate political participation due to the mobilizing property of anger (Valentino et al., 2011).  In other words, different types of affective polarization could be conceptualized based on specific underlying intra-/interparty attitudinal structures. Another differentiation between types of affective polarization could be based on different attitude objects, remedying the second source of conceptual underspecification. For example, partisans evaluating public officials may be categorized as ‘bottom-up affective polarization.’

Since its initial conceptualization, researchers have justified studying affective polarization by suggesting its potential threats to political systems (Iyengar et al., 2012). So far, research seems to suggest the opposite. By bringing conceptual clarity and a context-dependent understanding to the study of affective polarization, future research may answer with more certainty whether political ramifications occur or if the question should rather be under which circumstances affective polarization threatens democratic stability.
